# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and happiness indicators across countries. The analysis explores whether happier countries had better COVID-19 outcomes by examining correlations between pandemic impact and various happiness indicators such as GDP, life expectancy, and social support.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths data by country
- Explore worldwide happiness indicators and their distributions
- Investigate correlations between happiness metrics and COVID-19 outcomes
- Identify patterns and trends in the data
- Generate insights about the relationship between national happiness and pandemic resilience

## 📁 Dataset Description

### COVID-19 Datasets
- **covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv**: Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases by country and date
- **covid19_deaths_dataset.csv**: Daily COVID-19 deaths by country and date

### Happiness Dataset
- **worldwide_happiness_report.csv**: 2019 World Happiness Report data including:
  - Country name
  - Ladder score (happiness score)
  - Logged GDP per capita
  - Social support
  - Healthy life expectancy
  - Freedom to make life choices
  - Generosity
  - Perceptions of corruption

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Loading**: Import all three datasets using pandas
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Remove unnecessary columns (Lat, Long, Province/State)
   - Handle missing values
   - Standardize country names for merging
3. **Data Aggregation**: 
   - Sum COVID-19 cases and deaths by country
   - Calculate total confirmed cases and deaths per country

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for all key variables
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Distribution plots for happiness scores, GDP, and COVID-19 metrics
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Scatter plots showing relationships between variables
   - Box plots for outlier detection

### Data Integration
1. **Merging Datasets**: Combine COVID-19 data with happiness data by country
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients
3. **Statistical Testing**: Perform significance tests on correlations

## 📈 Key Findings

### COVID-19 Impact Analysis
- **Global Distribution**: Analysis of confirmed cases and deaths across countries
- **Regional Patterns**: Identification of high-impact and low-impact regions
- **Outlier Detection**: Countries with unusually high or low COVID-19 rates

### Happiness Indicators Analysis
- **Happiness Score Distribution**: Global happiness patterns
- **Economic Factors**: Relationship between GDP and happiness
- **Social Factors**: Impact of social support on happiness
- **Health Factors**: Correlation between life expectancy and happiness

### Combined Analysis
- **Happiness vs COVID-19 Outcomes**: Correlation between happiness scores and pandemic impact
- **Economic Resilience**: How GDP relates to COVID-19 outcomes
- **Social Support Impact**: Relationship between social support and pandemic resilience
- **Health Infrastructure**: Connection between life expectancy and COVID-19 outcomes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

3. Handle missing values appropriately
4. Standardize country names for merging

### Phase 3: Individual Dataset Analysis
1. Analyze COVID-19 data patterns
2. Explore happiness indicators
3. Identify outliers and unusual patterns
4. Generate insights for each dataset

### Phase 4: Integrated Analysis
1. Merge datasets by country
2. Perform correlation analysis
3. Create combined visualizations
4. Test statistical significance

### Phase 5: Insights and Conclusions
1. Interpret correlation results
2. Identify key patterns and trends
3. Draw conclusions about relationships
4. Suggest areas for further research

## ❓ Research Questions Addressed

1. **Do happier countries have better COVID-19 outcomes?**
2. **Is there a correlation between GDP and COVID-19 impact?**
3. **How does social support relate to pandemic resilience?**
4. **What role does life expectancy play in COVID-19 outcomes?**
5. **Are there regional patterns in the relationship between happiness and COVID-19?**
